									This is an Email collector application which collects the NAME , DOB , DATE and EMAIL of the user. 
									MailChimp is often the first newsletter tool that springs to mind, possibly because they have great marketing and a charming monkey-fied aesthetic. But I guess I’m not the only one, as they claim to send roughly 10,800 emails out every second over their platform.
									They offer a free plan, with which you can send up to 10,000 emails a month to 2,000 subscribers. This is good news for personal and SMB accounts, as most of the tools and templates are accessible on this free account.
									Another feature accessible through their free account is their in-built CRM. If you’re an SMB looking for an all-in-one solution then this could be just what you’re looking for. They also have pay-as-you-go options, which work out to be cheaper for low-volume clients.

									Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
									The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

									It happens every day—you're in the middle of working on something but get distracted by a notification. Perhaps you got an email from a friend telling you to read this interesting article. Maybe you checked a favorite blog and see a post that catches your attention, or stumbled across a site you know you'll want to check again in the future. There's something to see, but you don't have time to do so right now.
									It's easy for good content to vanish into the black hole of the internet. Don't. Bookmark it instead.There are two ways to do that. Traditional bookmarks save stuff forever—they keep details about a website around so you can reference and revisit them whenever you need. The somewhat newer Read it Later apps let you save stuff for now in a to-do list mixed with a magazine of sorts where you can catch up on things you'd otherwise miss.
									This application provides you to bookmark your important pasges and read them whenever you want it to .

									This is a WEB TEMPLATE which is fully responsive and available for free
									Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. 
									Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

									Early Babylonian and Egyptian records, as well as the Bible, indicate that weight was originally measured by the capacities of containers such as gourds or clay or metal vessels. These were filled with plant seeds that were then counted to measure the volumes. With the development of scales as a means of weighing, seeds and stones served as standards. For instance, the "carat," still used as a mass unit for gems, is derived from the carob seed.
									he kilogram is the weight of one liter of water. One thousandth of a kilogram is a gram. All multiples and submultiples of the base units are in powers of ten.The metric system was not particularly popular in revolutionary France, and the Emperor Napoleon, who came just after the Revolution, abolished it. But, when Napoleon lost power, the system was reinstated. This application helps you convert the weight in POUNDS into KILOGRAM , OUNCES ,and GRAMS.

									This is a simple basic calculator made with HTML5 , CSS 3 and JAVASCRIPT with memory functions similar to a small handheld calculator. Use this basic calculator for math with addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.
									Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, and calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices.Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, and calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices.
